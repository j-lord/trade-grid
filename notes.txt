Just some random thought for things that i have either done or need to do

Delete Commit History in Git Repository:

git checkout --orphan latest_branch         Checkout/Create Orphan Branch – Create a new orphan branch in your git repository
git add -A                                  Add All The Files to Branch – Add all existing files to your newly created branch
git commit -am "your new commit message"    Commit The Changes – After adding all files to your new branch, commit the changes  
git branch -D main                          Delete Main (Default) Branch – Now you can delete the main (default) branch from your git repository - permanent step
git branch -m main                          Rename The Current Branch – After deleting the old main (default) branch, rename the newly created branch to main
git push -f origin main                     Push Changes – All these changes are completed on your local repository and now its time to force push these changes to your remote repository

npm run make        this makes the application in the out file - this creates a stand alone application which would need to be re-made when an update is made
npm start           start the electron application




Keyboard shortcuts
These will be one of the major advantages of using this application
Electron has both local and global  keyboard shortcuts
Local are only available when the app is in focus
while global can we use when any application is in focus

Key Mapping 
Global shortcuts:
    - LAUNCH the application
    - Bring the electron app to the front of view
        - Same button as launch?
